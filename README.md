##  Project Experience

### Design of Lightweight Super-Resolution Network Structure/2018.09~2019.12
  - Most of the current super-resolution networks based on deep learning are very deep and large, which is not conducive to mobile applications. This project mainly using the hierarchical relationship between different scale features to improve the efficiency of the multi-scale module, and use the attention mechanism to improve the performance of the network. Based on this, the performance of our lightweight super-resolution network is better than that of CARN, LFFN and MSRN.
  - Paper：Lightweight Single Image Super-resolution through Efficient Second-order Attention Spindle
Network (ICME2020，CCFB)

### Design of Super-resolution Network Architecture for Multi-Degradation/2019.10~Now
  - Low-resolution images in real scenes are often degraded by noise and blurriness, etc. At present, although the super-resolution network achieves excellent results on the low-resolution images adopted in bicubic sampling, it is unsatisfactory in processing real data. This project considers to estimate blur kernel information through mixed Gaussian modeling, and training the kernel estimating network by using the back-projection loss function. Adding denoising and debluring modules to the super-resolution network, so that the network can process complex and diverse real data.
  
## Internship

### Central Media Research Institute of Huawei 
  - AutoML Technology Research Intern of Pixel Level Task: Designing the search space of image super-resolution task, we mainly consider to draw on the experience of the current network architecture designed by hand, and make use of the network architecture search technology to carry out more fine-grained search on this basis, so as to get the lightweight network with better performance and realize both speed and precision.
